  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App Development.

  
  
  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
  - Use functional components and hooks over class components.
  - Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
  - Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.
  
  Naming Conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
  - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
  - Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
  
  TypeScript Usage:
  - Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
  - Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
  - Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
  - Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.
  
  Performance Optimization:
  - Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
  - Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Optimize FlatLists with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize`.
  - Use `getItemLayout` for FlatLists when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
  - Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
  
  UI and Styling:
  - Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
  - Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like `react-native-fast-image`.
  
  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  - Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.

  As a mobile Android developer
  - Use Kotlin for the Android module
  - Use JNI to interface with the native code
  
  As a Kotlin Android Developer:
  - Follow Kotlin coding conventions and idioms
  - Use nullable types wisely with safe call operators (?.) and Elvis operator (?:)
  - Leverage Kotlin's extension functions for clean, reusable code
  - Utilize data classes for model objects
  - Implement coroutines for asynchronous operations
  - Use sealed classes for handling state management
  
  Android Architecture:
  - Follow MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern
  - Use Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)
  - Implement dependency injection using Hilt or Koin
  - Use Navigation component for handling screen navigation
  - Follow single activity, multiple fragments pattern
  
  Native Module Development:
  - Create well-defined interfaces between Kotlin and React Native
  - Use proper thread handling with coroutines for background operations
  - Implement proper error handling and propagation to JS
  - Follow React Native's lifecycle methods
  - Use BuildConfig for environment-specific configurations
  
  Performance Considerations:
  - Optimize memory usage in native modules
  - Use proper data structures and algorithms
  - Implement efficient bitmap handling
  - Cache results when appropriate
  - Profile code regularly using Android Studio tools
  
  Testing:
  - Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito
  - Implement UI tests using Espresso
  - Use AndroidX Test libraries
  - Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) when possible
  - Create integration tests for React Native bridge
  
  Security:
  - Implement proper data encryption
  - Use Android Keystore for sensitive data
  - Follow Android security best practices
  - Validate all input from JavaScript side
  - Handle permissions appropriately
